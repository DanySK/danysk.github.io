#### Abstract

Today's distributed and pervasive computing addresses large-scale cyber-physical ecosystems,
characterised by dense and large networks of devices capable of computation, communication
and interaction with the environment and people.
While most research focusses on treating these systems as "composites"
(i.e., heterogeneous functional complexes),
recent developments in fields such as self-organising systems and swarm robotics
have opened up a complementary perspective:
treating systems as "collectives"
(i.e., uniform, collaborative, and self-organising groups of entities).
This article explores the motivations, state of the art, and implications of this
"collective computing paradigm" in software engineering,
discusses its peculiar challenges, and outlines a path for future research,
touching on aspects such as macroprogramming, collective intelligence,
self-adaptive middleware, learning, synthesis,
and experimentation of collective behaviour.
