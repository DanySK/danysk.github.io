#### Abstract

Traditional BDI agents, rooted in logic programming, remain challenging to integrate with the hypermedia nature
of open Web environments that rely on Semantic Web technologies like RDF and OWL.
This paper examines the gap between these paradigms and surveys existing integration efforts
on a conceptual and technical level,
arguing that existing tools offer limited ergonomic support for developers.

The proposal for a deeper integration relies on a generalised BDI engine
to enable the development of BDI agents that can directly reason and operate on semantic hypermedia resources.
Ideal requirements are derived and an abstract architecture is presented
that can be tailored to support different types of beliefs and reasoning mechanisms.
