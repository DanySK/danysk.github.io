#### Abstract

Self-organising multi-robot systems hold great promise for tackling complex tasks in
unstructured and dynamic environments,
yet bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical deployments remains challenging.
In this work, we present a demonstrator showcasing a team of robots that collectively
self-organise their behaviour using aggregate computing.
The demonstrator illustrates how high-level, globally-specified collective behaviour
can be automatically mapped to individual robot actions,
supporting coordination patterns such as leader election, coverage, and formation control.
The system is implemented on physical hardware and is also reproducible in simulation,
making it a concrete testbed for collective adaptive robotics research.
