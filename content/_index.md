Hey,

I'm Danilo Pianini, a software engineer working at the [Alma Mater Studiorum - Universit√† di Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/danilo.pianini),
where I do research and teaching.

My research is focused on engineering techniques for self-organizing and self-adaptive systems.
You can find my publications in [my CV](https://github.com/DanySK/Curriculum-Vitae/releases/latest/download/curriculum.pdf),
and a reasonably up-to-date list is also available on [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/p/Pianini:Danilo)
and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0CLlt5oAAAAJ).

I designed (and currently maintain) [dozens of open source software tools](https://github.com/DanySK?tab=repositories).

I believe human time is short, precious and can not be wasted into repetitive and boring tasks.
Thus, I fell in love with automation and DevOps,
which I also teach in [my university courses](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/danilo.pianini/teachings).
